Day 40:
===========

a) Public Access Modifier

Public members are accessible from anywhere (inside or outside the class).
By default, all variables and methods in Python are public.

Example:

class Demo:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "Nikhil"   # public variable

    def show(self):
        print(self.name)

d = Demo()
d.show()
print(d.name)


Key Points:

No underscore prefix

Freely accessible

Least restrictive

b) Protected Access Modifier

Protected members are meant to be accessed within the class and its subclasses.
Defined using a single underscore (_) prefix.

Example:

class Parent:
    def __init__(self):
        self._salary = 50000   # protected variable

class Child(Parent):
    def show(self):
        print(self._salary)

c = Child()
c.show()


Key Points:

Convention-based protection

Accessible in subclasses

Not strictly enforced

c) Private Access Modifier

Private members are restricted to the class only.
Defined using double underscore (__), which enables name mangling.

Example:

class Bank:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__balance = 10000

    def show(self):
        print(self.__balance)

b = Bank()
b.show()
# b.__balance → Error


Key Points:

Stronger data hiding

Accessed internally only

Prevents accidental modification
